Fixing bugs and adding new features is a part of developing software applications.

From my experience,
sending application updates to users is also a critical part of
developing applications,
especially when the user has no advanced knowledge of computers.

In the Internet era today,
the software developer must make application deployment
and updating easier and often makes automatic application updates to do this.

I already searched through the internet on this topic,
but not much seems suited to my needs.

So, I tried to create one myself.
This sample application is developed in C# as a library
with the project name “AutoUpdater”.

The DLL “AutoUpdater” can be used in a C# Windows application(WinForm and WPF).

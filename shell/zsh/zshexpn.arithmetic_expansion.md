# ARITHMETIC EXPANSION

A string of the form `$[exp]` or `$((exp))`  is  substituted  with  the value  of the arithmetic expression `exp`.  

`exp` is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion 
before  it  is evaluated.  

See the section `Arithmetic Evaluation'.

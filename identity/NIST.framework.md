# NIST Framework at Grance

## Core

The Core is a lexicon of information security program management mechanisms 
that are common across critical infrastructure sectors.

For example, 
within the function Identify, 
there is the category Governance, 
which has a subcategory Organizational information security policy is established, 
which then provides four Informative References 
as examples of what an organization should consider implementing.
	“[The Framework Core] gives us a language 
which we can use to talk with each other about cybersecurity,” 
explained Barrett. 

“There are all sorts of ways risks manifest, 
and one of those ways is miscommunication. 
The Framework Core is a great mechanism 
to make sure that we’re using a universal language 
when we’re talking about information security program management.”

It also considers legal and regulatory requirements, 
industry best practices, and risk management priorities.

## Implementation Tier

Implementation Tiers consider an organization’s current risk management practices, 
threat environment, 
legal and regulatory requirements, objectives, and constraints. 

The Tier characteristics are measured at an organizational level to understand the current stateof a given risk practice.

Therefore, the Tiers are progressive, beginning with (1) Partial, then (2) Risk Informed, (3) Repeatable, and (4) Adaptive.“While they do build on each other, the Tiers weren’t necessarily designed such that everybody needs to strive for a 4 on the 1 to 4 scale,” Barrett explained. “The Tiers themselves are meant to 􏰣􏰒􏰋􏰅􏰀􏰅􏰆􏰒􏰆􏰁􏰄􏰒􏰄􏰆􏰍􏰒􏰇􏰁􏰐􏰩􏰄􏰒􏰈􏰒􏰀􏰎􏰊􏰅􏰊􏰄􏰇􏰅􏰒􏰀􏰐􏰓􏰌􏰁􏰄 about what is most appropriate for a given organization because we rec- ognize – as industry was informing us– that there’s a cost to doing business and to various decisions regarding how you manage risk.”

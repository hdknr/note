Warning: You have an outdated version of /usr/bin/install_name_tool installed.
This will cause binary package installations to fail.
This can happen if you install osx-gcc-installer or RailsInstaller.
To restore it, you must reinstall OS X or restore the binary from
the OS packages.

Warning: Git could not be found in your PATH.
Homebrew uses Git for several internal functions, and some formulae use Git
checkouts instead of stable tarballs. You may want to install Git:
  brew install git

Warning: You have a non-Homebrew 'pkg-config' in your PATH:
  /opt/local/bin/pkg-config

`./configure` may have problems finding brew-installed packages using
this other pkg-config.

Warning: You have not agreed to the Xcode license.
Builds will fail! Agree to the license by opening Xcode.app or running:
    xcodebuild -license

# MacPorts

これは移動。

~~~

Warning: You have MacPorts or Fink installed:
  /opt/local/bin/port

This can cause trouble. You don't have to uninstall them, but you may want to
temporarily move them out of the way, e.g.

  sudo mv /opt/local ~/macports

~~~

# /Developer/Library/uninstall-developer-folder

~~~  

Warning: You have leftover files from an older version of Xcode.
You should delete them using:
  /Developer/Library/uninstall-developer-folder
~~~

victoria:~ norico$ sudo rm -rf /Developer/Library/uninstall-developer-folder 
~~~

# OK

==> Pouring readline-6.3.8.mavericks.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Mac OS X provides similar software, and installing this software in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

OS X provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/readline/include

In order to use this build of bash as your login shell,
it must be added to /etc/shells.
